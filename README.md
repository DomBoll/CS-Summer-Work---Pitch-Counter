# CS-Summer-Work---Pitch-Counter
# Hi Ms. Burton! I am very new to github so I bet that my project isn't formatted very well, but I had three main stopping points in the development of my project when I chose to upload them. These are the three separate branches. The first is the "HelloWorld2" folder in the main branch, as that was the first code I was able to make that resembled a baseball app at all. Next was the "BaseballCounter" folder in the main branch, where I added more buttons, an intro screen where you could name the teams, etc. And my last version is the "BaseballCounter" folder in the "Final" branch, where you can change pitchers and where the stats at the end screen are more useful.
# I used java.swing to make the windows and inputs, so there shouldn't be any dependencies outside of java itself. The only folder you need to download to run the program is the "BaseballCounter" folder from the "Final" branch.
# Here is my video describing what the program does and what my experience working with java was this summer, as well as a little intro to what I have done in the past in terms of programming: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-u4M7m0tWkcgQ2YHEeKFf1XxsRhYIptP/view?usp=sharing](url)
